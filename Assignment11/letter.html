        <h2> Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2> 



        Dear Eileen, <br> <br>
        Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part
        <br>
        of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections. <br>

        <h3>Starting dates </h3>
        We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you
        <br>
        could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows: <br>

        <ul>
            <li>
                First semester: 9 September 2016
            </li>
            <li>
                Second semester: 15 January 2017
            </li>
            <li>
                Third semester: 2 May 2017
            </li>
        </ul>

        Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer. <br> <br>
        You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates </a> on our website. <br>
        <h3> Subjects of study </h3> 
        At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility – as long as the subjects fall
        <br>
        somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
        <br>
        the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued
        <br>
        by are as follows, in order of priority: <br>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Turning H <sub>2</sub>O  into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C <sub>14</sub> H <sub>12</sub>
                 O <sub>3</sub> .) <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the
                <br>
                audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10 <sup>3</sup>  increasing to 3 x 10 <sup>4</sup> .) <br>
            </li>
            <li>
                <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr>  and  <abbr title="CSS">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores. <br>
            </li>
        </ol>

        So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
        research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        <br>

        <h3>Exotic dance moves </h3> 
        Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your
        question, <br>
        my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions: <br> <br>

        Polynesian chicken dance
        <p class="padded" style="padding-left:30px; ">
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around
            <br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be <q>fruitful</q>.

        </p>


        Icelandic brownian shuffle <br>
        <p class="padded" style="padding-left:30px; ">
            Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
            <br>
            involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in
            imperceptibly <br>
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.
        </p>

        Arctic robot dance <br>
        <p class="padded" style="padding-left:30px; ">
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants
            <br>
            of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold. <br>
        </p>

        For more of my research, see my <a href="#">exotic dance research page.</a> <br> <br>
        Yours sincerely, <br> <br>
